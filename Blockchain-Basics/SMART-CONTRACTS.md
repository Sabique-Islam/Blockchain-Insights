A **Smart Contract** is a self-executing piece of code stored on a **blockchain** that runs automatically when predefined conditions are met. It eliminates the need for intermediaries in digital transactions.

---

### Features -->

- **Immutable** – Once deployed, it can't be changed.
- **Transparent** – Code is visible on the blockchain.
- **Trustless** – Doesn’t require third-party trust.
- **Autonomous** – Executes logic automatically.

---

### Working -->

```markdown
IF condition is met --> THEN execute action
```

For example:
- If Optimus Prime sends 2 ETH to a smart contract, then the smart contract releases a digital asset to Orion Pax. [Both  are same person]

### Common Use Cases

| Use Case         | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **DeFi**         | Lending, borrowing, staking, trading on-chain   |
| **NFTs**         | Minting and transferring digital assets         |
| **DAOs**         | Voting and governance through smart contracts   |
| **Escrow**       | Trustless payment release after service         |
| **Gaming**       | On-chain assets, verifiable randomness          |

### Risks

- **Bugs = Permanent** – Once deployed, buggy contracts can’t be easily fixed.
- **Gas Costs** – Running complex logic can be expensive.
- **Security** – Vulnerabilities like reentrancy can be exploited.
