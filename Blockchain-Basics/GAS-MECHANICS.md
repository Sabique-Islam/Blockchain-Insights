### **Block Rewards**
  - Miners (or validators in proof-of-stake) receive rewards for adding new blocks to the blockchain.
  - These rewards are typically paid in ETH and serve as an incentive for maintaining network security.
---
### **Advanced Gas**
  - Gas represents the computational effort required to perform operations on the Ethereum network.
  - Complex smart contracts consume more gas, and each operation has a predefined gas cost.
---
### **EIP 1559**
  - Introduced a new transaction pricing mechanism with a **base fee** burned and a **priority tip** to incentivize miners/validators.
  - Helps reduce gas fee volatility and improves fee estimation.
---

### **Summary**
  - Gas is essential for executing transactions and smart contracts.
  - EIP 1559 enhances user experience by stabilizing gas fees.
  - Understanding unit conversions (WEI, GWEI, ETH) is critical for evaluating transaction costs.
