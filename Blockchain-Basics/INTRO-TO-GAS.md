### Gas and Gas Fees

> Gas is the unit used to measure the computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network. 

Every transaction or smart contract interaction consumes gas, and users must pay gas fees in Ether (ETH) to incentivize validators to include their transaction in the blockchain.

**The more complex the operation, the higher the gas cost :**  Gas fees are dynamic and depend on factors like network congestion and the complexity of the transaction.

### Wei, Gwei, and Ether Converter

- **WEI** is the smallest denomination of ETH (1 ETH = 10^18 WEI).
- **GWEI** = 10^9 WEI, commonly used to express gas prices.
- **Ether**: The native cryptocurrency of Ethereum

Gas prices are typically quoted in Gwei, and tools like **[Ether converters](https://www.alchemy.com/gwei-calculator)** help users convert between Wei, Gwei, and ETH to understand the true cost of transactions.

### ETH Gas Station [ RIP ]

[ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info) is a useful tool for checking current gas prices, recommended transaction fees, and network congestion. It helps users determine the optimal gas price to avoid overpaying while ensuring timely processing.
