Smart contracts have transformed the blockchain ecosystem from simple value transfer systems to dynamic, programmable platforms with real-world applications.

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
Smart contracts power DeFi protocols, enabling decentralized lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming without intermediaries.

### Defi Llama
Defi Llama tracks the total value locked (TVL) across various DeFi platforms. It showcases the rapid growth of decentralized financial products and the wide adoption of smart contract-based applications.

### Why DeFi is Important
- Enables financial access for the unbanked
- Offers transparency and lower fees
- Eliminates reliance on traditional financial institutions
- Creates programmable, composable finance

### DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
Smart contracts form the backbone of DAOs—organizations governed by code and community rather than central leadership. They enable collective decision-making, transparent treasuries, and automated operations.

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
Smart contracts enable the creation, transfer, and verification of digital ownership through NFTs. These unique digital assets have revolutionized art, gaming, collectibles, and intellectual property.

Smart contracts have laid the foundation for a decentralized internet—where applications, finance, art, and governance operate independently of traditional control structures.
