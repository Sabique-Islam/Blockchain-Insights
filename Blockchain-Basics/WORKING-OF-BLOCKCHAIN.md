A **blockchain** is a distributed ledger [ a database ] technology that records data in a series of blocks, linked together using cryptography. It enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record-keeping across a decentralized network.

---

### Core Components -->

- **Block**: Contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block.
- **Chain**: A series of blocks linked together chronologically.
- **Node**: A computer in the blockchain network that maintains a copy of the ledger.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: A system (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) for nodes to agree on the validity of transactions.

### Step-by-Step Process -->

1. **Transaction Initiated**: A user requests a transaction (e.g., sending crypto).
2. **Transaction Broadcast**: The request is sent to a network of nodes.
3. **Validation**: Nodes validate the transaction using a consensus mechanism.
4. **Block Creation**: Valid transactions are grouped into a new block.
5. **Hash Linking**: The new block is cryptographically linked to the previous one.
6. **Chain Update**: The new block is added to the blockchain.
7. **Confirmation**: The transaction is complete and recorded permanently.

### Properties -->

- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the network.
- **Immutable**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered.
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible to participants.

### Applications -->

- **Cryptocurrencies** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- **Supply Chain Tracking**
- **Voting Systems**
- **Identity Management**
- **Smart Contracts and dApps**
